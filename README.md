This is Carpool Buddy, an application for anyone affiliated with CIS to carpool with each other and go to school as an effort to reduce carbon emissions. 

The CIS community has been making a few strides towards reducing carbon emissions. DITO created a whole report where they calculated that the CIS community emits an estimated 214 tons of CO2 and approximately 6.4 million kilometers annually from commuting. 
One of their possible solutions to reducing this number is to have fewer students travel to school by personal car. About 32% of our commuting is done by driving single-family cars to CIS.

This app looks to connect and encourage the CIS community to carpool together. 

Features:
1. Members can sign up with their CIS emails - the application will automatically identify their affiliation with CIS.
2. Members can book a seat in someone else's ride on a specific date.
3. Members can register their vehicles to create their rides.
4. Members can open and close their rides at any given moment.
5. Members can access the rides they have booked and the rides they have created.
6. Members can delete their vehicles and their rides.
7. Members can access the contact information of the member who owns a ride they have booked.
8. Members can input a carpool pick-up location of their choice. 
9. Members can access a Map navigation that maps out the route that the ride will take on the day.
